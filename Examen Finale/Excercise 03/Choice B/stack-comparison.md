# Queue-Based Stack Implementation Comparison

## Experimental Setup
- Tested with multiple push operations
- Tracked iterations and total operations

## Single Queue Approach
### Characteristics
- Uses single queue
- Rotation-based stack simulation
- Push complexity: O(n)

### Metrics
- Push Iterations: Depends on current queue size
- Rotation method applied each push
- Minimal additional memory overhead

## Two Queue Approach
### Characteristics
- Uses two queues
- Transfer-based stack simulation
- Push complexity: O(n)

### Metrics
- Push Iterations: Depends on main queue elements
- Complete queue transfer for each push
- Additional memory required

## Comparative Analysis

| Metric | Single Queue | Two Queue |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Push Iterations | Linear with queue size | Linear with queue size |
| Memory Usage | O(1) extra | O(n) extra |
| Push Time Complexity | O(n) | O(n) |
| Implementation Complexity | Lower | Slightly Higher |

## Conclusion
Both approaches provide stack functionality with trade-offs between memory efficiency and operational complexity.
